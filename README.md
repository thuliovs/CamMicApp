## Project Overview
The **CamMicApp** project is an Android application I developed to explore the integration of camera and microphone functionalities within an Android environment. This project demonstrates how to capture photos, record audio, and manage media files efficiently.

## Features
- **Camera Integration**: Implemented functionality to capture photos using the device's camera and save them locally.

- **Microphone Recording**: Enabled audio recording using the device's microphone with proper permission handling.

- **Media Management**: Provided options to preview captured images and play recorded audio files within the application.

## Lessons Learned
Developing this project provided valuable insights into:

- **Camera API Usage**: Understanding how to access and utilize the Android Camera API to capture and store images efficiently.

- **Audio Recording and Permissions**: Learning how to handle microphone access, manage audio recording, and implement runtime permissions in compliance with Android security guidelines.

- **File Storage and Media Playback**: Exploring best practices for saving, retrieving, and playing media files within an Android application.
